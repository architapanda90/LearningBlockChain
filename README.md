# LearningBlockChain
Repository hosts all the smart contracts written and deployed while learning blockchain.
Started developing  using solidity on remix editor to write a simple smart contract called Inbox.sol. The main function of the smart contract was to replace an initial message, a string with a new message.Solidity compiler was used to compile the code to generate the byte code and the abi. Then the contract was deployed to the rinkeby test network in metamask using infura.Testing the contract was done using mocha.
