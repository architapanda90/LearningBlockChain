# LearningBlockChain

Started developing  using solidity on remix editor to write a simple smart contract called Inbox.sol. The main function of the smart contract was to replace an initial message, a string with a new message.Solidity compiler was used to compile the code to generate the byte code and the abi. Then the contract was deployed to the rinkeby test network in metamask using infura.Testing the contract was done using mocha.

ReduxSimpleStarter was used to learn react-js to develop dapp(frontend) for the smart contract

lottery has the smart contract and lotttery-react has the front-end developed using react.Together they form a lottery dapp

Kickstart has both the campaign contract and its front-end developed using react
